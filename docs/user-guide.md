# Mir User Guide

## What is Mir?

Mir is a new way to interface with large language models. It is currently _work-in-progress_.

## Configuration

### How do I configure settings?

The _Settings_ panel can be opened using the gear icon in the top right of the application window, or the "Settings..." menu option in the Application menu.

Note that the Settings panel is shown automatically on app launch until a connection is configured.

### How do I connect Mir to an API?

Open Settings and in the _Connection_ section enter the base API URL (OpenAI `OPENAI_BASE_URL` style). Add the API key if the endpoint requires one.

The base URL should look like

```sh
https://api.openai.com/v1
```

Mir will call the `/chat/completions` path on that base URL. This is the only API endpoint the app currently uses.

Most inference providers, including OpenAI itself, provide support for this so called "Chat completion" endpoint (Anthropic is the notable exception).

You can also optionally specify a model name in Settings (for example `gpt-5.2`). Depending on your inference provider, the model name might be required or optional (if the inference provider has a default model).

### Where is the API key stored?

If secure storage is available on your device, Mir encrypts your key and saves it on your devices' secure storage so that you do not have to re-enter it each time.

If secure storage is not available, Mir keeps your key only for the current session. The key is cleared when the app closes.

### Where is the base URL stored?

The base URL is saved on your device so you do not need to re-enter it.

### What data is sent to the API?

Mir sends the current conversation context to the configured endpoint in a chat-completions format, along with your API key if provided.

### Will my settings sync across devices?

Not yet. Sync is planned and will use end-to-end encryption when it is introduced.

### How do I clear my key?

Delete the API key from the Connection section. If secure storage is available, Mir will remove the saved entry. If not, closing the app also clears it.

## Primitives

### Underlying

LLMs (as of today) take a string of input tokens, and generate a string of output tokens.

A common API interface that has pseudo standardized over this base mechanism is to consider the input as a sequence of "messages" (where each message is a string of tokens), and then treat the output as just another message. This way the output of the previous interaction simply becomes part of the input messages for the next interaction.

These input messages are called "context".

What goes into context is entirely up to our imagination.

### Mir

So Mir treats _messages_ and _context_ as underlying primitives.

* **Messages** themselves carry over into the UI as immutable strings of tokens, written either by a human, or generated by an LLM, or some other alchemy.

* However, the context is not reified until the actual generation. We have an infinite field of messages which can be combined in arbitrary ways, but to keep things manageable and tangible, messages are grouped into **Collections**.

## Collections

A new collection can be started using the _New Collection_ button on the top bar, or via File -> New Collection (`Ctrl + N` on Linux/Windows, `Cmd + N` on macOS).

A list of collections can be seen in the _Collections_ tab of the sidebar (Use `Ctrl + E` on Linux/Windows, `Cmd + E` on macOS to quickly toggle it on and off).

### Minimap

Each collection shows a minimap in the context bar above the message composer.

Every dot represents a message in the collection, ordered from oldest to newest. The active message is emphasized, and messages currently within the viewport are shown with a lighter highlight so you can orient yourself at a glance.

## Messages

A new message can be added to a collection using the composer at the bottom of the main pane. Tokens you add become a message, are folded into the current context, the resultant context is submitted to the model for generation, and the model’s continuation is stored as a new message.

### Composing messages

Compose a message in the composer area. Use the _Add_ button to submit it into the context.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts:

- Press `Enter` to complete the message and generate a continuation.
- Alternatively, use `Shift + Enter` for a newline. Once your draft has newlines, use `Ctrl + Enter` on Linux/Windows or `Cmd + Enter` on macOS to complete the message and trigger generation.

### Customizing generation parameters

You can customize parameters passed to the model along with the context when asking it to generate a continuation. Currently, Mir exposes only temperature.

#### Temperature

The _TEMP_ pill near the Add button lets you set the temperature for the next continuation.

> Temperature controls how deterministic or varied the model output is. Lower values are more focused and repeatable; higher values are more exploratory.

## Other features

- Automatic light/dark mode that follows the system's setting.
- Easy controls for customizing generation parameters for each message.
- Keyboard friendly design, with handy and documented keyboard shortcuts for navigation and various functions.
